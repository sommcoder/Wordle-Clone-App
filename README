///// Wordle-ish Game ////

User functionality:

- user has a visual qwerty keyword they can type OR use their keyboard

- entries populate from left to right
- back space functionality
- enter or enter key submits answer

Game Logic:

- Each Refresh creates a RANDOM word for the user to guess. correctAnswer

split the correctAnswer word into individual letters

- Conditional:
  - if letter is present in one location of the word, background: yellow
  - if letter is in the exact location it should be, background: green

-after each full word attempt, move to the next row for a new round of guessing

-the rows operate intependently, once a row is attempted, its state remains

-

Visuals:

- as new letters are inputted, the square shakes and grey border turns to black once user submits input

- errors:
  "not enough letters"
  "not a word"
  "
